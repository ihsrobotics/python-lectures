# Part 1)
# Write a simple recursive function (a function that calls itself)
# to solve the fibonacci sequence using the definition of Fibonacci:
# F(x) = F(x-1) + F(x-2); F(0) = 0; F(1) = 1
# Then, demonstrate why this is inefficient

# Part 2)
# update this function using lru_cache

# Part 3)
# rewrite this function using dynammic programming rather than recursion
