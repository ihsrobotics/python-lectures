    "Inheritance is the ability for a class to inherit, or get, fields and methods from another class. It is useful in many ways, but mostly because it improves code reusability (since you don't have to write the same methods out again). Before we get into it, here's some terminology:\n",
    "- super/parent class - this is the class from which fields and methods are inherited/taken from\n",
    "- sub/child class - this is the class that inherits/gets the fields and methods\n",

    "Now, to give you an idea about inheritance, let's think about dogs. All dogs bark, have four legs, and have two ears. If `Dog` was a class, it would have fields for its ears and legs, and a bark method. Now, if there was a specific dog Jeff who was trained to shake hands, then this dog Jeff will still have four legs, still have two ears, and still bark just like a regular dog. The only difference is that it would have another method for shaking hands. That is because dogs like Jeff that can shake hands are still dogs, so they inherit all the behaviors and attributes of regular dogs. Now, let's say that there's another dog Jeoffrey that barks differently than Jeff. Is it still a dog? Yes, because it still barks. Even though dogs like Jeoffrey bark differently than default dogs, they are still dogs.\n",

In our above example, dogs who are `Jeoffrey` are `Dog`s, as are dogs who are `Jeff`. "

    "Now that we know what inheritance does, let's discuss another way that inheritance (and overriding) is useful. We're going to talk about abstraction. Abstraction is the process of \"abstracting\", or removing details, from your code. But why would we want to remove details? Abstraction is useful when you know that all subclasses should have a certain behavior, but you don't know exactly what that behavior will look like, so you don't want to write one thing only to have it get overridden in every single subclass. Think about our dog example. All dogs should be able to wag their tails (if they have one). However, every dog wags its tail a little differently. Thus, we would remove details from the `wag_tail` method in the `Dog` class and then put those details in the subclasses' versions of `wag_tail`. Thus, any program that takes a `Dog` object can know for sure that that object will be able to wag its tail (because of inheritance), although it won't know exactly how that dog wags its tail (it's always a surprise)."

Then, since we don't actually have control over memory, we let Python handle the allocation. That's what the `super().__new__(cls)` does. All classes inherit from `object`, which is a Python builtin, and thus eventually your class's new will call object's new which will do the allocation.\n",

    "You may not see why the `__new__` method is so important. Well, as the documentation mentions, it is very useful in metaclasses. So, what is a metaclass? In essence, a metaclass is a \"class factory\", or a class that determines how classes are made. Often, it will define the `__new__` method to a custom method. To specify an object as having a certain metaclass, we do something very similar to how we specified parent classes. The format is: `class ClassName(metaclass=MetaClassName):`. The metaclass, in turn, should derive from `type`. This is why the `__new__` method must contain the arguments `cls`, `name`, `bases`, and `dct`. `type`'s `__new__` method takes the class to instantiate, the name of the class, any bases (parent classes) that the class has, and a namespace dictionary, or a dictionary of all the properties that are in the class. Thus, a metaclass's `__new__` must take those as well."
